# cppelements

A collection of various classes and utilities that are probably not part of the standard library.
I say probably not part because this codebase is old (really old), but some things are still relevant.

The main philosophy was to provide building blocks that allow you to create efficient code. Such an example are lambda utilities, which allow you to pass functors with specific capture size.

You can find:
- various pools
- various allocators
- fixed containers (string/vector)
- lambda utilities
- a basic ini parser
- views (array view, string view)
- string utilities, parsing numbers, string containers
- a basic smart pointer
- some other legacy classes and structs
